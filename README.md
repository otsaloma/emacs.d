emacs.d
=======

This is my personal Emacs configuration, i.e. `~/.emacs.d`. It is
unlikely to be of much interest to others as a whole, but is available
for reading and inspiration.

All needed packages not included in Emacs itself should be available via
ELPA. You can install them in one go with the following shell command.

    ./bootstrap.sh

My emacs.d is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL), see
the file [`COPYING`](COPYING) for details. See also my [docsets][] for
documentation packages used by default by this configuration.
